<h2>What is Pampito Thermal Printer?</h2>
Pampito Thermal Printer is a REST API that allows you to connect your systems to Windows shared thermal printers. Built with Node.js and Electron, it provides a simple application that handles sending print commands to the designated printer.

    }
  ]
}
</pre>
<h4>JSON Fields:</h4>
